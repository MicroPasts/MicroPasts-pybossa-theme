            The <strong>{{brand}}</strong> crowd-sourcing platform uses the free and open source framework
            <a href="http://dev.pybossa.com">PyBossa</a> which is released under the 
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0</a> 
            and all of the source code for the applications is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa">GitHub</a>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            For datasets, we make a distinction between <em>source</em> data and <em>derived</em> data. Our crowd-sourcing
            applications use digital <em>source</em> data (for example photographs, scanned documents) to allow 
            contributors to complete research tasks such as the development of 3D models, photo-tagging and transcription. 
            This <em>source</em> data will typically b available through a fully open <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> license  or a
	    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> license, but in some cases might be 
	    placed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC</a>
            or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a> licenses when the institutions 
            owning the archaeological or archival material have asked that commercial use is prohibited without further 
            consultation (we hope that this will be infrequent).
            </p>
      
            <p>
            All the <em>derived</em> data, produced with the help of volunteers
            via crowd-sourcing, is licensed under an open CC0 or CC BY license, depending on case-by-case agreements 
            with our partners.
