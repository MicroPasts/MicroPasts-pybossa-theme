<p>You can assist existing research projects with tasks that need human
intelligence, such as the accurate location of artefact findspots or
photographed scenes, the identification of subject matter in historic
archives, the masking of photos meant for 3D modelling, or the transcription of
letters and catalogues. Other tasks might require on-location
contributions by members of the public, such as submitting your own
photographs of particular archaeological sites or objects. By
contributing to a MicroPasts project you will:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Have a direct impact on research in archaeology, history and heritage</li>
  <li>Help with tasks that computers cannot do</li>
  <li>Develop skills that interest you</li>
  <li>Produce results that will be open and freely usable</li>
</ul>
